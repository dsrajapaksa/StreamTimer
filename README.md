# MyStreamTimer
A cool app to count up or down that writes text to file for streamers.


Currently consists of a WPF app written with [.NET Core 3-preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-3/) and VS 2019. Contains all logic in a .NET Standard Library so we can port it over to macOS.
